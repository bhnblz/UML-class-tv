# Description
This Python programs include tree attributes for the television's mode, such as on or off, volume level (1–7), and channel (1–120). There are several methods available in this program, including turn on, turn off, get channel, set channel, get volume, set volume, and increase or decrease channel and volume by 1. To verify whether the functions in the primary Python file (class_tv) are valid and functioning, the test_tv program is being created, which creates two objects with varying volumes and channels.

# Main file (class_tv)
Here's what the main file looks like:

In this file, you'll see the different methods that are being requested for us to include in this program. 

# Test_tv drive
On the other hand, the separate file named test_tv looks like this:

# Run the Program
To run this program, you just need to set channel and volume and it will display the output just like this:

# Disclaimer
You can add more methods to this program depending on what you need.
